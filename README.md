HarbBot
=======

My attempt at a teamspeak bot
========
dependencies:
Windows (might port it over to linux, one day)
Perl
TeamSpeak (duh) with ClientQuery (comes with TS, but is normally disabled)

How to install:
drop the bot file in the folder for the respective server the bot has to run in
configure settings (soon to be in a seperate file) at the top of the bot file

How to start the bot:
Start Teamspeak
run the TsBot.pl file

How to stop the bot:
close the shell for the bot
OR have an admin execute the right command.
